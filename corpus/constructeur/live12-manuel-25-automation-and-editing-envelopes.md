# 25. Automation and Editing Envelopes


## 25.1 Recording Automation in Arrangement View

25. Automation and Editing Envelopes
Often, when working with Live’s mixer and devices, you will want the controls’ movements to become
part of the music. The movement of a control across the song timeline or Session clip is called 
automation; a control whose value changes in the course of this timeline is automated. Practically all
mixer and device controls in Live can be automated, including the song tempo.
25.1 Recording Automation in Arrangement View
Automation can be recorded to the Arrangement View in two ways:
By manually changing parameters while recording new material directly into the Arrangement.
By recording a Session View performance into the Arrangement, if the Session clips contain
automation.
During Session-to-Arrangement recording, automation in Session clips is always recorded to the
Arrangement, as are any manual changes to parameters in tracks that are being recorded from the
Session.
When recording new material directly to the Arrangement, the Automation Arm button determines
whether or not manual parameter changes will be recorded.
The Automation Arm Button.
When Automation Arm is on, all changes of a control that occur while the Control Bar’s Arrangement
Record button is on become Arrangement automation. Try recording automation for a control; for
instance a mixer volume slider. After recording, play back what you have just recorded to see and
hear the effect of the control movement. You will notice that a little LED has appeared in the slider
thumb to indicate that the control is now automated. Try recording automation for track panning and
the Track Activator switch as well; their automation LEDs appear in their upper left corners.

## 25.2 Recording Automation in Session View

Volume, Pan and the Track Activator Switch Have Been Automated.
25.2 Recording Automation in Session View
Automation can also be recorded to Session View clips. Here is how it works:

Controls for Recording Session Automation.
Enable the Automation Arm button to prepare for automation recording.
Activate the Arm button for the tracks onto which you want to record. Clip Record buttons will
appear in the empty slots of the armed tracks.
Click the Session Record button to begin recording automation.
It is also possible to record automation into all playing Session clips, regardless of whether or not they
are in armed tracks. This is done via the Session Automation Recording switch in the Record, Warp &
Launch Settings.
The Session Automation Recording Preference.
This allows you to, for example, overdub Session automation into an existing MIDI clip without also
recording notes into the clip.

### 25.2.1 Session Automation Recording Modes


## 25.3 Deleting Automation


## 25.4 Overriding Automation

Any automation in Session View becomes track-based automation when clips are recorded or copied
into Arrangement View.
25.2.1 Session Automation Recording Modes
The automation recording behavior differs depending on how you adjust parameters while recording.
When using the mouse, recording stops immediately when you let go of the mouse button. This is
referred to in some editing applications as “touch” behavior. When adjusting parameters via knobs or
faders on MIDI controllers, recording will continue as long as you adjust the controller. When you let
go, recording will continue until the end of the clip’s loop and then will “punch out” automatically. This
is known as “latch” behavior in some applications.
25.3 Deleting Automation
To delete all automation data, right-click on an automated control to open its context menu and select
Delete Automation, or press the Ctrl
Backspace  (Win) / Cmd
Delete  (Mac) shortcut keys. The
automation LED disappears, and the control’s value stays constant across the entire Arrangement
timeline and in any Session View clips. You can also delete selected portions of automation by editing
breakpoint envelopes.
25.4 Overriding Automation
In practice, you will often want to try out new control moves without overwriting existing automation
data in the Arrangement. Well, nothing is forever in the world of infinite Undo, but it’s easy to disable
a control’s automation temporarily to avoid overwriting existing data: If you change an automated
control’s value while not recording, the automation LED goes off to indicate the control’s automation is
inactive. Any automation is therefore overridden by the current manual setting.
When one or more of the automated controls in your Live Set are not active, the Control Bar’s Re-
Enable Automation button lights up.
The Re-Enable Automation Button.
This button serves two purposes. It reminds you that the current state of the controls differs from the
state captured in Session clips or the Arrangement, and you can click on it to reactivate all automation
and thereby return to the automation state as it is written “on tape.“

## 25.5 Drawing and Editing Automation

You can also re-enable automation for only one parameter via the Re-Enable Automation option in
the context menu for that parameter. And in the Session View, you can re-enable overridden
automation by simply relaunching a clip that contains automation.
25.5 Drawing and Editing Automation
In the Arrangement View and in Session View clips, automation can be viewed and edited as
breakpoint envelopes.
Here is how automation editing works in the Arrangement:
Automation Envelopes in the Arrangement View.
To show automation envelopes, enable Automation Mode by clicking the 
 toggle button
above the track headers, or using the A  shortcut to the View menu item. Note that you can
disable Automation Mode by pressing the 
 toggle button or A  shortcut key again.
Clicking on a track’s mixer or device controls will display this control’s envelope on the clip
track.
Envelopes appear in the track’s main automation lane, “on top of“ the audio waveform or MIDI
display. This is useful for lining up breakpoints with the track’s audio or MIDI content. An
envelope’s vertical axis represents the control value and the horizontal axis represents time. For
switches and radio buttons, the value axis is “discrete”, meaning that it operates with non-
continuous values (e.g., on/off).
The Device chooser either selects the track mixer, one of the track’s devices, or “None“ to hide
the envelope. It also provides you with an overview of which devices actually have automation

### 25.5.1 Drawing Envelopes

by showing an LED next to their labels. You can make things clearer still by selecting “Show
Automated Parameters Only“ from the bottom of the chooser.
The Automation Control chooser selects a control from the device chosen in the Device chooser.
The labels of automated controls have an LED.
The 
 button moves the envelope into its own automation lane below the clip. You can then
select another automation parameter from the choosers to view it simultaneously. Holding Alt
(Win) / Cmd  (Mac) while pressing the 
 button moves the selected envelope, as well as all
automated envelopes, into their own automation lane(s) below the clip. If the Device chooser is
set to “None“, this button will be hidden.
The 
 button hides its respective automation lane. Note that hiding a lane from view does not
deactivate its envelope. Holding Alt  (Win) / Cmd  (Mac) while clicking the 
 button
removes the selected automation lane, as well as any subsequent automation lanes in that
track.
The 
 toggle appears when an envelope is moved into its own automation lane. This toggle
lets you show or hide all additional automation lanes.
Right-clicking on an automation lane header opens a context menu with additional options for
viewing envelopes. This context menu also contains commands to quickly clear all automation
envelopes for the track or any of its devices.
You can use the left arrow key to navigate from an automation lane to the main track, this will fold all
automation lanes as well. Using the left and right arrow keys on a main track will fold/unfold its
automation lanes.
Automation editing for Session View clips is covered in detail in the Clip Envelopes chapter.
25.5.1 Drawing Envelopes
With Draw Mode enabled, you can click and drag to “draw“ an envelope curve.
The Draw Mode Switch.
To toggle Draw Mode, select the Draw Mode option from the Options menu, click on the Control
Bar’s Draw Mode switch, or press B . Holding B  while editing with the mouse temporarily toggles
Draw Mode.

### 25.5.2 Editing Breakpoints

Drawing an Envelope.
Drawing creates steps as wide as the visible grid, which you can modify using a number of handy
shortcuts. Holding down the Shift  modifier while dragging vertically allows you to adjust the
automation value of a step at a finer resolution.
For freehand drawing, you can hide the grid using the Snap to Grid Options menu entry or the Ctrl
4  (Win) / Cmd
4  (Mac) shortcut. To temporarily enable freehand drawing while the grid is
shown, hold down Alt  (Win) / Cmd  (Mac) while drawing.
25.5.2 Editing Breakpoints
With Draw Mode off, the envelope display looks and works differently. The line segments and the
breakpoints connecting them become draggable objects. Clicking and dragging in the envelope’s
background defines a selection. Here’s how editing breakpoints works:
Click at a position on a line segment to create a new breakpoint there.
Double-click anywhere in the envelope display that is not on a line segment, to create a new
breakpoint there.
Click on a breakpoint to delete it.
To help you edit breakpoints more quickly, automation values are shown when you create,
hover over, or drag a breakpoint. Note that when hovering over or dragging a selected line
segment, the automation value shown will correspond to the breakpoint closest to the cursor.

A Breakpoint’s Automation Value.
Click and drag a breakpoint to move it to the desired location. If the breakpoint you are
dragging is in the current selection, all other breakpoints in the selection will follow the
movement. When dragging a breakpoint, a thin black vertical line will appear to help you see
where your breakpoint is positioned in relation to the grid lines.
Right-click on a breakpoint and choose Edit Value from the context menu. This allows you to set
an exact value in the editable field using your computer keyboard. If multiple breakpoints are
selected, they will all be moved relatively. Similarly, you can also create new breakpoints at an
exact value by right-clicking on a preview breakpoint and choosing the Add Value command.
Click near (but not on) a line segment or hold Shift  and click directly on a line segment to
select it. With the left mouse button held down, drag to move the line segment to the desired
location. If the line segment you are dragging is in the current time selection, Live will insert
breakpoints at the selection’s edges and the entire segment will move together.
To Move all Breakpoints Within the Selection, Drag Any One of Them.
Breakpoints created close to a grid line will automatically snap to that line. Hold down the 
Alt  (Win) / Cmd  (Mac) modifier while dragging horizontally to bypass grid snapping.
Breakpoints and line segments will snap to time positions where neighboring breakpoints exist.
You can remove a neighboring breakpoint by continuing to drag a breakpoint or line segment
“over” it horizontally.
When moving a line segment or breakpoint, hold Shift  while dragging to restrict movement
to either the horizontal or vertical axis.

### 25.5.3 Stretching and Skewing Envelopes

Holding down the Shift  modifier while dragging vertically allows you to adjust the
breakpoint or line segment value at a finer resolution.
Hold Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) and drag a line segment to curve the segment. Double-
click while holding Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) to return the segment to a straight line.
A Curved Envelope Segment.
25.5.3 Stretching and Skewing Envelopes
The Handles Allow You to Stretch or Skew Envelopes.
When hovering over a time selection, handles appear around the outer edges of the selection.
Clicking and dragging these handles allows you to transform the selected automation in the following
ways:
Dragging the top and bottom center handles lets you stretch the automation along the vertical
axis. While dragging, a rectangle indicates the amount of stretching. The rectangle will snap to
upper and lower boundaries and when its corners intersect. Holding Shift  allows you to
finely adjust the amount of stretching. Dragging beyond the boundaries will clip the envelope.

### 25.5.4 Simplifying Envelopes

While Dragging a Handle, A Rectangle Indicates the Amount of Stretching or Skewing.
Dragging the left and right center handles lets you stretch the automation along the horizontal
axis. Dragging over existing breakpoints outside the time selection will remove them. If you hold
Shift  while stretching, these breakpoints will be moved in proportion to the movement of the
handle. Hold down the Alt  (Win) / Cmd  (Mac) modifier while dragging horizontally to
bypass grid snapping.
Dragging any of the corner handles lets you skew the automation. While dragging, a rectangle
indicates the degree of skewing. The rectangle will snap to upper and lower boundaries and
when its corners intersect. Holding Shift  allows you to finely adjust the amount of skewing.
Dragging a handle while holding Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) will mirror the movement in
the opposite handle, as if you were dragging them both simultaneously in opposite directions.
25.5.4 Simplifying Envelopes
If your automation envelope has a lot of breakpoints, e.g., after recording automation, the Simplify
Envelope command can be quite useful. Simplify Envelope calculates the optimal number of
breakpoints needed to represent the selected automation envelope, and removes any unnecessary
breakpoints, replacing them with straight lines or curved segments where appropriate.
The Simplify Envelope Command Removes Unnecessary Breakpoints.
Make a time selection on the automation you wish to simplify, and choose Simplify Envelope from the
context menu.

### 25.5.5 Inserting Automation Shapes

25.5.5 Inserting Automation Shapes
Automation Shapes Inserted into an Envelope.
Automation shapes can help you quickly create complex rhythmic automation patterns, as well as
more subtle, slow-paced movements like swells, builds and drops.
There are several predefined automation shapes that you can apply to a time selection. To insert an
automation shape, right-click on a time selection and choose a shape from the context menu.
The Two Rows Contain Different Types of Automation Shapes.
There are two types of automation shapes. In the top row of available shapes, you’ll find several
common waveforms: sine, triangle, sawtooth, inverse sawtooth and square. When inserted, these
shapes will be scaled horizontally to the time selection and vertically to the automated parameter
range. If there is no time selection, the shapes will be scaled horizontally to the current grid size.
In the bottom row of available shapes are two sets of ramps, and an ADSR shape. These shapes
behave slightly differently than those on the top row. When inserted, they will link up to the value of
the automation before or after the selection, as indicated by their dotted line.

### 25.5.6 Locking Envelopes


### 25.5.7 Edit Menu Commands


### 25.5.8 Editing the Tempo Automation

25.5.6 Locking Envelopes
When moving Arrangement View clips, Live normally moves all automation with the clip. Sometimes,
you might want to lock the envelopes to the song position rather than to the clips, and the Lock
Envelopes switch does just that.
You can also choose to lock envelopes from the Options menu.
The Lock Envelopes Switch.
25.5.7 Edit Menu Commands
When working with automation data in the Arrangement View, several Edit menu commands behave
differently depending on whether or not your selection is within the clip track or its automation lanes.
Cut, Copy, Duplicate or Delete commands applied to an envelope selection within a single lane will
only apply to this envelope. The clip itself and other automation that occurs in that time selection will
be unaffected. You can also work with envelopes in multiple lanes simultaneously.
If you want your edits to apply to both the clip and all of its associated envelopes, ensure the Lock
Envelopes switch is disabled and apply edit commands to a selection in the clip track.
Note that Live allows you to copy and paste envelope movements not only from one point in time to
another, but also from one parameter to another. Since the parameters may be completely unrelated,
this can have unexpected (but possibly interesting) results.
25.5.8 Editing the Tempo Automation
The ability to dynamically stretch and compress audio to track any tempo or tempo variation is one of
Live’s specialties. In Live, the song tempo is just another automated control.
To edit the song tempo envelope, unfold the Main track in Arrangement View, choose “Mixer“ from
the top envelope chooser and “Song Tempo“ from the bottom one.
481

The Tempo Envelope.
When adjusting the tempo envelope, you might want to scale the value axis display, which is the
function of the two value boxes below the envelope choosers: The left box sets the minimum, and the
right box sets the maximum tempo displayed, in BPM.
Note that these two controls also determine the value range of a MIDI controller assigned to the
tempo.
