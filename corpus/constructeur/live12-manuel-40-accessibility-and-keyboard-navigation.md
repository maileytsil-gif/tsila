# 40. Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation


## 40.1 Menu and Keyboard Navigation Settings


### 40.1.1 Using Tab for Navigation

40. Accessibility and Keyboard
Navigation
Live 12 offers new accessibility features on both macOS and Windows, including support for screen
readers and other assistive technologies that use the accessibility communication protocols native to
those operating systems. Additional improvements include a high-contrast option for new themes,
streamlined keyboard navigation, and a more organized Settings menu.
While most of Live’s views, controls, and devices work with screen readers, some device features have
not been optimized to do so, such as the Modulation Matrix in Wavetable and some advanced
parameters in Operator. Several other Live and third-party features are not yet supported for screen
reader use, including:
Browser tagging and filters
MPE editing in Clip View
Max for Live
Some third-party plug-ins
For answers to common questions about Live’s accessibility support, please refer to the Accessibility in
Ableton Live FAQ in the Knowledge Base.
40.1 Menu and Keyboard Navigation Settings
Various accessibility and keyboard navigation options can be found in Live’s Settings, as well as in the
Options and Navigate menus.
In addition to improved keyboard navigation, various keyboard shortcuts are available for common
actions and commands.
40.1.1 Using Tab for Navigation
When the Use Tab Key to Move Focus option is enabled via the Navigate menu or Live’s Display &
Input Settings, the Tab  key can be used to navigate in the following ways:
Tab  moves to the next control.
Shift
Tab  moves to the previous control.

### 40.1.2 Settings Menu

The Tab  key can also be used to navigate between controls in the Session and Arrangement mixers
via these shortcuts:
Ctrl
Tab  (Win) / Option
Tab  (Mac) moves to the next control in the same row.
Ctrl
Shift
Tab  (Win) / Option
Shift
Tab  (Mac) moves to the previous control in
the same row.
When Use Tab Key to Move Focus is off, pressing the Tab  key switches between Session and
Arrangement View, as in previous versions of Live.
In addition to using Tab  to move focus, the following navigation options are also available:
Wrap Tab Navigation - When this option is enabled, pressing Tab  moves focus back to the
first control after reaching the last one in an area instead of stopping. If the first control is
selected, pressing Shift
Tab  moves focus to the last control. This option can be enabled via
the Navigate menu or the Display & Input Settings.
Move Clips with Arrow Keys - This option is enabled by default and lets you use the left and
right arrow keys to move selected clips and/or the time selection in Arrangement View. This
behavior can be switched off in the Display & Input Settings if needed. When off, pressing the
left arrow key collapses the time selection to the start point, while pressing the right arrow key
collapses the time selection to the end point.
40.1.2 Settings Menu
To open Live’s Settings, use the shortcut Ctrl
,  (Win) / Cmd
,  (Mac).
The Tab  and Shift
Tab  keys can be used to navigate between options inside the Settings tabs.
These shortcuts work regardless of whether the Use Tab Key to Move Focus option is active or not.
When a command is focused in any of the Settings tabs, the up and down arrow keys can be used to
change the state of a toggle, make value adjustments, or cycle through the available options for a
given command. It is also possible to use the Enter  key to switch between toggle states.
To navigate between the different tabs in the Settings Page Chooser, use Ctrl
Tab  (Win) / 
Option
Tab  (Mac) and Ctrl
Shift
Tab  (Win) / Option
Shift
Tab  (Mac) or the up
and down arrow keys when the chooser is focused. If the keyboard focus is on the first control of any
given Settings tab, use the Shift
Tab  shortcut to return the focus to the Settings Page Chooser.
You can close the Settings window by using the Esc  key.
Note that if you choose a new preferred language for the UI in the Display & Input Settings, Live must
be restarted for the change to take effect.

### 40.1.3 Options Menu


### 40.1.4 Speak Help Text


## 40.2 Audio Setup


## 40.3 Connecting MIDI Devices

40.1.3 Options Menu
You can find further accessibility settings in Live’s Options menu, which contains an Accessibility sub-
menu. To access this sub-menu with the keyboard, use Alt
O  (Win) / VO
M  then O  with
VoiceOver (Mac).
The sub-menu contains several entries for enabling certain screen reader announcements, such as
Speak Menu Commands, Speak Minimum and Maximum Slider Values, and Speak Time in Seconds.
40.1.4 Speak Help Text
Most controls and areas in Live include descriptive text, accessible via the Info View. On Windows,
you can enable screen reader announcements for these descriptions by activating the Speak Help
Text option in your preferred screen reader. On macOS, you can do so by turning on help text in the
VoiceOver Utility’s verbosity settings. You can also access this option manually by pressing VO
Shift
H .
40.2 Audio Setup
To configure your audio settings in Live, open the Settings menu using the shortcut Ctrl
,  (Win) / 
Cmd

You can use Tab  to move between the options on the Audio page and start configuring your audio
device settings.
Audio setup varies between macOS and Windows. On macOS, Live’s input and output can be
connected to any CoreAudio device. You can also select other drivers from the Driver Type drop-
down menu if needed. On Windows, you can select your preferred driver, for example ASIO4ALL,
and manage connected devices via the driver’s own program.
40.3 Connecting MIDI Devices
Live automatically detects connected MIDI devices, many of which require no further configuration.
Some MIDI controllers also come with control surface scripts to help integrate them into Live’s
workflows. Note that screen reader support for control surfaces varies between third-party
manufacturers, so some controllers may not be optimized for use with screen readers.

The Help View contains a selection of lessons, which are short tutorials covering different aspects of
Live. Tab  and Shift
Tab  can be used to navigate between the controls in this view.
40.5 Editing Automation and Modulation
Envelopes
You can use the computer keyboard to add, edit, and delete breakpoints in automation and
modulation envelopes. Screen readers provide feedback for each action as you make changes.
The actions described below are supported in automation lanes for tracks in the Arrangement View,
as well as in the Envelope Editor for clips.
40.5.1 Navigating Between Breakpoints
You can navigate automation and modulation envelopes using the insert marker, which indicates the
current location on the grid. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the insert marker. As you move
across the envelope, the automation or modulation value at the current location is displayed.
The Automation Value is Shown at the Insert Marker Location.
To create a breakpoint at the insert marker’s location, press Enter . You can either press Enter
again to confirm, or move the breakpoint with the left and right arrow keys before pressing Enter  to
place it at a new location.
Press Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) and the left or right arrow key to jump to the previous or next
breakpoint.
When navigating through breakpoints, the currently focused breakpoint is displayed in a different
color from the main envelope. This same color is used when hovering over breakpoints with the
mouse.

### 40.5.2 Selecting and Editing Breakpoints

A Focused Breakpoint.
40.5.2 Selecting and Editing Breakpoints
To select an existing breakpoint at the insert marker’s location, press the Enter  key.
You can also hold Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) and click a breakpoint to move the insert marker to
its location and select it.

editable.
A Breakpoint Pulses When Selected.
Moving a selected breakpoint and then undoing the action with Ctrl
Z  (Win) / Cmd
Z  (Mac)
causes the previously moved breakpoint to briefly change to the same color shown when a
breakpoint is focused or hovered over. This makes it easier to identify which one was affected —
especially when editing vertically aligned breakpoints.

and deselect the breakpoint. Alternatively, press Esc  to cancel the change and deselect the
breakpoint.
