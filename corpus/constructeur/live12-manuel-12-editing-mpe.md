# 12. Editing MPE

12. Editing MPE
MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) is an extension to the MIDI specification that enables attaching
parameter control information to individual notes, instead of globally per MIDI channel. This way of
using MIDI allows MPE-capable devices to control multiple parameters of every note in real time for
more expressive instrumental performances.
To enable Live to receive per-note expression from an MPE-capable MIDI controller, first enable MPE
Mode in the Link, Tempo & MIDI Settings for that controller.
Enabling MPE Mode for a MIDI Controller.
Note that when selecting a MIDI controller that has MPE enabled as an input device on a track, the
channel input routing is fixed to “All Channels’’ and no individual channels can be selected.
For more information about working with MIDI controllers, please refer to the MIDI and Key Remote
Control chapter. Once your controller is set up, you can use it to record new MIDI clips containing
MPE data.
The Clip View’s Note Expression tab allows viewing and editing five dimensions of MPE for each note
in a clip: Pitch (per-note pitch bend), Slide (per-note Y-Axis), Pressure (Poly Aftertouch/MPE

## 12.1 Viewing MPE Data

Pressure), Velocity and Release Velocity (Note Off Velocity). This makes it possible to refine the
expression of recorded material, or to automate polyphonic sound variations for MPE-capable
instruments.
Note that you can view and edit MPE data for notes in all MIDI clips, regardless of whether those
clips were created using an MPE-capable device or using other methods. We will look at viewing and
editing MPE data in the following sections.
12.1 Viewing MPE Data
A MIDI Clip with MPE Data in the Clip View.
To view MPE data in a MIDI clip, first enter Clip View by double-clicking on a clip, then click on the
Note Expression Tab or use the key command Alt
3  (Win) / Option
3  (Mac) to open the
Expression Editors at the bottom of Clip View. Four of the five MPE parameters are contained in their
own expression lane: Slide, Pressure, Velocity, and Release Velocity. By default, only Slide and
Pressure are shown. Envelopes for the fifth parameter, Pitch, are displayed on top of their
corresponding notes in the MIDI Note Editor.
Each expression lane can be shown or hidden via the lane selector toggle buttons at the left.
Underneath the lane selector toggle buttons, a triangular toggle button allows showing/hiding all
enabled lanes at once.
311


## 12.2 Editing MPE Data

These Buttons Toggle Visibility of Expression Lanes.
When all expression lane selectors are hidden/disabled, pressing the triangular toggle button will
show all expression lanes at once. Each expression lane can be resized individually via their split
lines. All expression lanes can be resized simultaneously by dragging the split line between the lanes
and the MIDI Note Editor.
Pressing Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) and clicking the triangular toggle button displays all
expression lanes. When hiding the expression lanes using the triangular toggle button, or by dragging
the Expression Editor View split line, the lane visibility toggles are hidden as well.
MIDI track meters will display MPE per-note controller changes. The lowest dot in a meter lights up in
a blue color if per-note controller changes pass that meter.
12.2 Editing MPE Data
When clicking a note (or any of its expression dimensions) in the MIDI Note Editor while the Note
Expression tab is open, the note will appear in a transparent overlay. Envelopes appear, along with
any existing breakpoints, to allow editing the note’s Pitch, Slide, and Pressure envelopes, while
markers can be used to edit the note’s Velocity and Release Velocity values. Unselected notes will
appear grayed out, and their expression envelopes will be dimmed.

Select a Note to View Its Expression Envelopes.
After clicking on the note or envelope you wish to edit, all expression breakpoints for the chosen
envelope and the line segments connecting them become draggable objects. Clicking and dragging
in the envelope’s background defines a selection. Here’s how editing MPE data works:
Click at a position on a line segment to create a new breakpoint there.
Click on a breakpoint to delete it.
To help you edit breakpoints more quickly, expression values are shown when you create,
hover over, or drag a breakpoint. Note that when hovering over or dragging a selected line
segment, the expression value shown will correspond to the breakpoint value at the cursor’s
current position.
A Breakpoint’s Expression Value.
Click and drag a breakpoint to move it to the desired location. If the breakpoint you are
dragging is in the current selection, all other breakpoints in the selection will follow the
movement.
Right-click on a breakpoint and choose Edit Value from the context menu. This allows you to set
an exact value in the editable field using your computer keyboard. If multiple breakpoints are
selected, they will all be moved relatively. Similarly, you can also create new breakpoints at an
exact value by right-clicking on a preview breakpoint and choosing the Add Value command.
Click near (but not on) a line segment or hold Shift  and click directly on a line segment to
select it. With the left mouse button held down, drag to move the line segment to the desired

location. If the line segment you are dragging is in the current time selection, Live will insert
breakpoints at the selection’s edges and the entire segment will move together.
To Move all Breakpoints Within the Selection, Drag Any One of Them.
In the Note Expression tab, the grid is disabled by default for easier editing at a finer resolution.
Note that the grid’s settings are separate from the grid in the other tabs, and they are saved
with the clip.
If needed, you can enable the grid using the Snap to Grid options menu entry or the Ctrl
4  (Win) / Cmd
4  (Mac) shortcut. When the grid is enabled, breakpoints and line
segments will snap to time positions where neighboring breakpoints exist. Breakpoints created
close to a grid line will automatically snap to that line.
When moving a line segment or breakpoint, hold Shift  while dragging to restrict movement
to either the horizontal or vertical axis.
Holding down the Shift  modifier while dragging vertically allows you to adjust the
breakpoint or line segment value at a finer resolution.
You can remove a neighboring breakpoint by continuing to drag a breakpoint or line segment
“over” it horizontally.
Hold Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) and drag a line segment to curve the segment. Double-
click while holding Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) to return the segment to a straight line.
A Curved Envelope Segment.
Except for the Pitch expression envelope, you can scale Slide, Pressure, Velocity and Release
Velocity envelopes proportionally across a note’s entire duration, similar to that of velocities for

## 12.3 Drawing Envelopes

multiple selected notes. To so do, first click outside of the note’s area, then hover the mouse
above the desired envelope. When the envelope turns blue, click and drag up or down, and
the envelope will be scaled accordingly. This is also the behavior when editing expression
envelopes for multiple selected notes at once.
You can also adjust all selected breakpoints equally, rather than scaling them. To do so, first
click on the envelope you wish to edit, then use Ctrl
A  (Win) / Cmd
A  (Mac) to select
all of the breakpoints, then drag up or down with the mouse as desired to increase or decrease
their value; dragging left or right will move all breakpoints horizontally as a group.
When a note is moved, its expression envelopes will move along with it.
Stretching a MIDI note using the MIDI stretch markers in the MIDI Editor or the ÷2 and x2
buttons in the Notes tab will cause any per-note expression belonging to that note to be
stretched as well.
Pitch breakpoints snap to the nearest semitone when pressing Alt  (Win) / Cmd  (Mac) while
the grid is off. This also works for Pitch values in Draw Mode. This behavior can be bypassed
using the same shortcuts when the grid is on.
Pitch envelopes are hidden when Fold Mode is enabled in the Note Expression tab.
When the Note Expression tab is open, using the Zoom to Clip Selection command or Z  key
shortcut adjusts the zoom level according to pitch bend values contained in the time selection.
When the Note Expression tab is open, the Clear All Envelopes entry in the context menu of the
MIDI Note Editor and per-note expression lanes clears all expression envelopes of one or
multiple selected notes.
12.3 Drawing Envelopes
With Draw Mode enabled, you can click and drag to free-handedly “draw“ an envelope in the Pitch,
Slide and Pressure expression lanes.
To toggle Draw Mode for MPE data, select the Draw Mode Option from the Option menu, click on
the Control Bar’s Draw Mode switch, or press B , then click on the envelope you wish to edit.
Holding B  while editing with the mouse temporarily toggles Draw Mode.

## 12.4 MPE in Live’s Devices and on Push 2


## 12.5 MPE in External Plug-ins


## 12.6 MPE/Multi-channel Settings

Holding down the Shift  modifier while dragging vertically allows you to adjust the expression
value of a step at a finer resolution.
When the grid is enabled using the Snap to Grid options menu entry or the Ctrl
4  (Win) / Cmd
4  (Mac) shortcut, drawing creates steps as wide as the visible grid, which you can modify using a
number of handy shortcuts. To temporarily enable drawing in the grid while it is disabled, hold down 
Alt  (Win) / Cmd  (Mac) while drawing.
12.4 MPE in Live’s Devices and on Push 2
Many Live devices support MPE and include MPE presets that bring new dimensions of interaction
and playability to your sound. The expressive possibilities within these devices also enable you to take
advantage of polyphonic aftertouch on Push 2.
12.5 MPE in External Plug-ins
MPE data for MPE-enabled plug-ins can also be accessed and modulated in Live.
The enabled/disabled state of a plug-in device’s MPE Mode will be saved with that device’s default
configuration.
Plug-ins that have MIDI outs and that have MPE enabled can also output MPE.
12.6 MPE/Multi-channel Settings
To set up a specific MPE configuration, you can access a MPE/Multi-channel Settings dialog box
from:
The Ext. Instrument device.
The I/O section of Live’s mixer.
The context menu of an MPE-enabled plug-in.
These settings can be used for hardware synths that require a specific MPE configuration, or plug-ins
that do not officially support MPE but can be used with MPE controllers due to their multi-timbral
support.

### 12.6.1 Accessing the MPE/Multi-channel Settings Dialog

12.6.1 Accessing the MPE/Multi-channel Settings Dialog
In the Ext. Instrument device, you can choose your Routing Target in the MIDI To drop-down menu.
Then select MPE from the second drop-down, open the menu again, and select MPE Settings…
The MPE Settings in Ext. Instrument.
To access these settings in the I/O section of the mixer, make sure you have the device you want to
control selected in the MIDI To section of the MIDI track’s output and choose MPE from the MIDI To
drop-down menu in the Session or Arrangement Mixer, then open the drop-down menu again and
choose MPE Settings…

### 12.6.2 The MPE/Multi-Channel Settings Dialog

12.6.2 The MPE/Multi-Channel Settings Dialog
The MPE/Multi-channel Settings.
You can use the settings to:
Configure the MPE zone and range of note channels used by Live when sending MPE to an
external MIDI device or plug-in.
Select the upper or lower zone and number of note channels.
Select multi-channel mode, which sets an arbitrary range of note channels.
There are settings available for the lower zone and upper zone. A track can only output to a single
zone, so to use both zones, set up two tracks.
Each zone needs a global channel (for non-polyphonic controls). The global channel for the lower
zone is Channel 1, and Channel 16 is for the upper zone. You can also assign a range of the other
MIDI channels to each zone (in general the number of channels you assign to a zone is linked to the
amount of polyphony you want in that zone). An example zone configuration might be to use
channels 1-11 for the lower zone and channels 12-16 for the upper zone.
Note: Live only supports zones for MPE output, which is particularly useful for hardware synths that
require a particular zone configuration.
These settings can also be used, for example, to connect two MPE synths to the same MIDI interface
(again, one connected through the MIDI thru of the other), or setting up a synth that knows how to
control two different sounds by assigning them to different zones. You can set up two MIDI tracks in
Live, routed to the same MIDI output device, but configuring one track for the lower zone and the
other for the upper zone.
