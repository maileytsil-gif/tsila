## 37.1 Managing the CPU Load


### 37.1.1 The CPU Load Meter

37. Computer Audio Resources and
Strategies
Real-time audio processing can be a demanding task for general-purpose computers, which are
usually designed to run spreadsheets and surf the Internet. An application like Live requires a powerful
CPU and a fast SSD. This chapter will provide some insight on how you can avoid and solve computer
resource issues when using Live.
37.1 Managing the CPU Load
To output a continuous stream of sound through the audio hardware, Live has to perform a huge
number of calculations every second. If the processor can’t keep up with what needs to be calculated,
the audio will have gaps or clicks.
Factors that affect computational speed include processor clock rates (e.g., speed in MHz or GHz),
architecture, temperature (in hot environments, modern CPUs will “thermal throttle” and slow down the
CPU processing rate), memory cache performance (how efficiently a processor can grab data from
memory), and system bus bandwidth — the computer’s “pipeline“ through which all data must pass.
Fortunately, Live supports multicore and multiprocessor systems, allowing the processing load from
things like instruments, effects, and I/O to be distributed among the available resources. Depending
on the machine and the Live Set, the available processing power can be several times that of older
systems.
37.1.1 The CPU Load Meter
The Control Bar’s CPU meter displays how much of the computer’s computational potential is currently
being used. For example, if the displayed percentage is 10 percent, the computer is just coasting
along. If the percentage is 100 percent, the processing is being maxed out — it’s likely that you will
hear gaps, clicks or other audio problems.
Note that the CPU meter takes into account only the load from processing audio, not other tasks the
computer performs (e.g., managing Live’s user interface).

The CPU Load Meter.
The CPU meter can display the Average or Current CPU usage, or it can be switched off entirely.
The Average CPU meter displays the average percentage of the CPU currently processing audio,
rather than the overall CPU load. The Current CPU meter displays the total current CPU usage.
You can click on the CPU meter to display the various options.
The CPU Load Meter Options.
By default, Live will not display the Current level; it must be enabled from the drop-down menu.
In new installations of Live 11, the CPU Overload Indicator will also be switched off by default. This
option can be re-enabled from the drop-down menu as needed by selecting Warn on Current CPU
Overload.
To determine the CPU load, Live calculates the time it needs to process one audio buffer. This value is
then compared to the time it takes to actually play one audio buffer.
For example, a value of 50% on the CPU meter means that Live is processing one audio buffer twice
as fast as it takes to play the buffer.
Values over 100% are possible when the calculation takes more time than it does to play one audio
buffer.

### 37.1.2 CPU Load from Multichannel Audio


### 37.1.3 CPU Load from Tracks and Devices

Live expects that the audio thread will have the highest priority, however the final prioritization of
threads is done by the operating system, meaning Live’s processing might get interrupted. This is why
other applications may cause CPU spikes in Live’s CPU meter.
37.1.2 CPU Load from Multichannel Audio
One source of constant CPU drain is the process of moving data to and from the audio hardware. This
drain can be minimized by disabling any inputs and outputs that are not required in a project. There
are two buttons in the Audio Settings to access the Input and Output Configuration dialogs, which
allow activating or deactivating individual ins and outs.
Live does not automatically disable unused channels, because the audio hardware drivers usually
produce an audible “hiccup“ when there is a request for an audio configuration change.
37.1.3 CPU Load from Tracks and Devices
Generally, every track and device being used in Live incurs some amount of CPU load. However, Live
is “smart“ and avoids wasting CPU cycles on tracks and devices that do not contribute anything
useful.
For example, dragging devices into a Live Set that is not running does not significantly increase the
CPU load. The load increases only as you start playing clips or feed audio into the effects. When there
is no incoming audio, the effects are deactivated until they are needed again. If the effect produces a
“tail,“ like reverbs and delays, deactivation occurs only after all calculations are complete.
While this scheme is very effective at reducing the average CPU load of a Live Set, it cannot reduce
the peak load. To make sure your Live Set plays back continuously, even under the most intense
conditions, play back a clip in every track simultaneously, with all devices enabled.
In the Session View, it is possible to see each track’s impact on the CPU load by clicking on the Show/
Hide Performance Impact selector in the Mixer Section.
The Show/Hide Performance Impact selector.
In the Performance Impact section, each track has its own CPU meter with six rectangles that light up
to indicate the relative impact of that track on the CPU level of the current Set. Freezing the track with
the largest impact or removing devices from that track will usually reduce the CPU load.

### 37.1.4 Track Freeze

The Session View’s Performance Impact Section.
37.1.4 Track Freeze
Live‘s Freeze Track command can greatly help in managing the CPU load incurred by devices and
clip settings. When you select a track and execute the Freeze Track command, Live will create a
sample file for each Session clip in the track, plus one for the Arrangement. Thereafter, clips in the
track will simply play back their “freeze files“ rather than repeatedly calculating processor-intensive
device and clip settings in real time. The Freeze Track command is available from Live‘s Edit menu and
from the context menu of tracks and clips. Be aware that it is not possible to freeze a Group Track; you
can only freeze tracks that hold clips.
Normally, freezing happens very quickly. But if you freeze a track that contains an External Audio
Effect or External Instrument that routes to a hardware effects device or synthesizer, the freezing
process happens in real-time. Live will automatically detect if real-time freezing is necessary, and
you‘ll be presented with several options for managing the process. Please see the section on real-time
rendering for an explanation of these options.
Once any processing demands have been addressed (or you have upgraded your machine!), you
can always select a frozen track and choose Unfreeze Track from the Edit menu to change device or
clip settings. On slower machines, you can unfreeze processor-intensive tracks one at a time to make
edits, freezing them again when you are done.
Many editing functions remain available to tracks that are frozen. Launching clips can still be done
freely, and mixer controls such as volume, pan, and the sends are still available. Other possibilities
include:
Edit, cut, copy, paste, duplicate, and trim clips.
Draw and edit mixer automation and mixer clip envelopes.
Consolidate clips.
Record Session View clip launches into the Arrangement View.
Create, move, and duplicate Session View scenes.
Drag frozen MIDI clips into audio tracks.

## 37.2 Managing the Disk Load

When performing edits on frozen tracks that contain time-based effects such as reverb, you should
note that the audible result may be different once the track is again unfrozen, depending on the
situation. This is because, if a track is frozen, the applied effects are not being calculated at all, and
therefore cannot change their response to reflect edited input material. When the track is again
unfrozen, all effects will be recalculated in real time.
A Frozen Arrangement Track with a Reverb Tail.
Frozen Arrangement View tracks will play back any relevant material extending beyond the lengths of
their clips (e.g., the “tails“ of Reverb effects). These frozen tails will appear in the Arrangement as
crosshatched regions located adjacent to their corresponding clips. They are treated by Live as
separate, “temporary“ clips that disappear when unfrozen, since the effect is then calculated in real
time. Therefore, when moving a frozen clip in the Arrangement, you will usually want to select the
second, frozen tail clip as well, so that the two remain together.
For frozen Session clips, only two loop cycles are included in the frozen clip, which means that clips
with unlinked clip envelopes may play back differently after two loop cycles when frozen.
Dragging a frozen clip to the drop area in the Session View or Arrangement View will create a new
frozen track containing that clip. If a clip is partially selected in the Arrangement, the new frozen track
will contain the selected portion of the clip only.
The samples generated by the Freeze Track command are stored in the Current Project folder under /
Samples/Processed/Freeze. If the Set has not yet been saved, the folder location will be specified by
the Temporary Folder. Please note that freeze files for tracks that contain an External Instrument or
External Audio Effect will be discarded immediately when unfreezing.
Besides providing an opportunity to conserve CPU resources on tracks containing a large number of
devices, the Track Freeze command simplifies sharing projects between computers. Computers that
are a bit low on processing power can be used to run large Live Sets as long as any CPU-intensive
tracks are frozen. This also means that computers lacking certain devices used in one Live Set can still
play the Set when the relevant device tracks are frozen.
37.2 Managing the Disk Load
An SSD’s read/write speed can affect Live’s performance. The amount of disk traffic Live generates is
roughly proportional to the number of audio channels being read or written simultaneously. For
928

example, a track playing a stereo sample causes more disk traffic than a track playing a mono
sample.
The Disk Overload Indicator.
The Disk Overload indicator flashes when the disk was unable to read or write audio quickly enough.
When recording audio, this condition causes a gap in the recorded sample; when playing back, you
will hear dropouts.
Do the following to avoid disk overload:
Reduce the number of audio channels being written by choosing mono inputs instead of stereo
inputs in the Audio Settings’ Channel Configuration dialog.
Use RAM Mode for selected clips.
Reduce the number of audio channels playing by using mono samples instead of stereo
samples when possible. You can convert stereo samples to mono using any standard digital
audio editing program, which can be called up from within Live.
