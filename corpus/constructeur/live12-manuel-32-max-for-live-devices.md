# 32. Max for Live Devices

32. Max for Live Devices
Live comes with a selection of custom-designed, built-in Max for Live devices. These devices include
instruments, effects, and MIDI Tools.
If you use the Suite edition or the Standard edition with the Max for Live add-on, Max for Live devices
can be opened in Max. This means you can edit and customize them in the Max editor — unlike
native Live devices.
For more information about editing devices in Max, check out the Editing Max for Live Devices and 
Building Max for Live MIDI Tools sections.
To learn the basics of using devices in Live, check out the Working with Instruments and Effects
chapter.
Note that different editions of Live have different feature sets, so some devices covered in this
reference may not be available in all editions.

## 32.2 Max for Live Audio Effects


### 32.2.1 Align Delay

32.2 Max for Live Audio Effects
32.2.1 Align Delay
The Align Delay Effect
Align Delay is a utility device that delays incoming signals in samples, milliseconds, or meters/feet.
Using the Delay Mode drop-down menu, you can choose between three delay modes: Time,
Samples, and Distance.
Time mode sets the delay in milliseconds and can be used to align audio with A/V equipment or
create subtle stereo widening.
Samples mode sets the delay in samples and can be used to compensate for latency introduced by
other devices.
Distance mode sets the delay in meters or feet and can be used to correct timing offsets caused by
physical distances between components in a PA system.
There is also a Temperature option for Distance mode, which includes a toggle for selecting Celsius or
Fahrenheit and a slider for setting the temperature. Matching these to the current temperature in the
room results in more precise timing as sound travels differently in warm and cold environments.
Activate the Link L/R toggle to apply the left channel’s delay settings to the right channel. When
enabled, the Delay Right slider is grayed out, and adjusting the Delay Left slider affects both channels.
784


### 32.2.2 Envelope Follower

32.2.2 Envelope Follower
The Envelope Follower Effect.
Envelope Follower is a modulator device that captures the amplitude of an incoming signal and
shapes it into a continuous curve. This curve can then be used to control mapped parameters. The
auto-wah effect is a common application of envelope following.
You can map any automatable parameter in Live to Envelope Follower, such as device or mixer
parameters. To do so, activate the Map button and click a parameter to assign it as a mapping target.
Use the Show/Hide Multimap button at the top right of the display to access additional mapping
buttons. You can map up to eight parameters in total.
785

You Can Map up to Eight Parameters.
To unassign a parameter, click the Unmap button to the right of the Map button.
Envelope Follower can control mapped parameters in two different ways: Modulation and Remote
Control. Modulation is selected by default, but you can use the Mod toggle to switch to Remote
Control.
When Modulation is enabled, parameter values can be freely adjusted even after they are mapped.
The Modulation Polarity toggle switches between the Bipolar and Unipolar modes. In Bipolar mode,
modulation occurs in both directions with the base value at the center. In Unipolar mode, modulation
is applied in a single direction from the base value. Use the Modulation Amount slider to set the
modulation depth. This determines the modulation range relative to the base value.
When Remote Control is enabled, parameter values are determined solely by Envelope Follower and
cannot be changed manually. Use the Min and Max sliders to scale the modulation range.
You can use the Gain knob to set the gain applied to the incoming signal. The Rise parameter smooths
the attack of the envelope, while the Fall control smooths the release of the envelope. These controls
can be used to refine the envelope’s shape.
The Delay control sets the delay time of the envelope. You can switch between time-based delay and
tempo-synced beat divisions with the Delay Mode buttons.
Envelope Follower uses the track’s input signal to generate the envelope by default. You can enable
sidechain routing to use an external signal from a different track instead. For example, you can
sidechain the signal from a Drum Rack to create rhythmic ducking or gating effects.
786

The Sidechain Section in Envelope Follower.
You can use the triangle toggle at the top left of the device to expand the Audio Routing panel and
access the sidechain controls.
To set up sidechain routing, activate the Sidechain toggle and select the audio source via the first
drop-down menu in the Audio From section. Use the second drop-down menu to choose whether the
signal is received Pre FX, Post FX, or Post Mixer. You can also select the exact input channel when
using Racks.
The Direct and S.C. meters display the current level of the track input and the external sidechain signal,
respectively.
You can set the blend between the track input and the external sidechain signal via the Sidechain Mix
control. At 0%, only the track input is used to generate the envelope; at 100%, only the external
sidechain signal is used.
787


### 32.2.3 LFO

32.2.3 LFO
The LFO Effect.
LFO is a modulator device that controls mapped parameters using low-frequency oscillation.
You can map any automatable parameter in Live to LFO, such as device or mixer parameters. To do
so, activate the Map button and click a parameter to assign it as a mapping target.
Use the Show/Hide Multimap button at the top right of the display to access additional mapping
buttons. You can map up to eight parameters in total.
788

You Can Map up to Eight Parameters.
To unassign a parameter, click the Unmap button to the right of the Map button.
LFO can control mapped parameters in two different ways: Modulation and Remote Control.
Modulation is selected by default, but you can use the Mod toggle to switch to Remote Control.
When Modulation is enabled, parameter values can be freely adjusted even after they are mapped.
The Modulation Polarity toggle switches between the Bipolar and Unipolar modes. In Bipolar mode,
modulation occurs in both directions with the base value at the center. In Unipolar mode, modulation
is applied in a single direction from the base value. Use the Modulation Amount slider to set the
modulation depth. This determines the modulation range relative to the base value.
When Remote Control is enabled, parameter values are determined solely by LFO and cannot be
changed manually. Use the Min and Max sliders to scale the modulation range.
Use the Waveform drop-down menu to select one of nine waveforms: Sine, Up, Down, Triangle,
Square, Random, Bin, Stray, and Glider.
The Shape control bends or skews the shape of the LFO waveform, while the Steps slider adds up to
24 steps to the waveform. Note that certain waveforms cannot be shaped or stepped due to how their
values are generated. Therefore, the Shape control is grayed out when Random, Bin, Stray, or Glider
is selected, and the Steps control is grayed out when Random, Bin, or Square is selected.
The Jitter slider adds randomness to the LFO output, while the Smooth control softens any sharp
changes in the output, including those from applied jitter.
The Rate control sets the LFO rate. Use the Time Mode toggles to switch between frequency values in
Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions. When Hz is selected, you can enable the ×10 button to
multiply the frequency value.
789

Depth sets the amount of modulation for all mapped parameters. At 0%, no modulation is applied,
while at 100% the LFO output is applied at its maximum level.
The Offset control adjusts the center point of the LFO output. At 0%, the output is centered. Positive
values shift the output upward, while negative values shift it downward. The horizontal line in the
display indicates the center and can be a helpful visual reference when adjusting Offset.
You Can Shift the Center Point of the LFO Output Using Offset.
The Phase slider shifts the position of the LFO within its cycle from 0% (the start of the cycle) to 100%
(the end).
To freeze the LFO output at its current value, activate the Hold toggle. Disable Hold to restart the LFO
from the previously held value.
Click the R (Retrigger) button to retrigger the LFO from the position defined by the Phase control.
790


### 32.2.4 Shaper

32.2.4 Shaper
The Shaper Effect.
Shaper is a modulator device that uses a breakpoint envelope to generate mappable modulation
data.
You can map any automatable parameter in Live to Shaper, such as device or mixer parameters. To
do so, activate the Map button and click a parameter to assign it as a mapping target.
Use the Show/Hide Multimap button at the top right of the display to access additional mapping
buttons. You can map up to eight parameters in total.
You Can Map up to Eight Parameters.
To unassign a parameter, click the Unmap button to the right of the Map button.
Shaper can control mapped parameters in two different ways: Modulation and Remote Control.
Modulation is selected by default, but you can use the Mod toggle to switch to Remote Control.
When Modulation is enabled, parameter values can be freely adjusted even after they are mapped.
The Modulation Polarity toggle switches between the Bipolar and Unipolar modes. In Bipolar mode,
modulation occurs in both directions with the base value at the center. In Unipolar mode, modulation
791

is applied in a single direction from the base value. Use the Modulation Amount slider to set the
modulation depth. This determines the modulation range relative to the base value.
When Remote Control is enabled, parameter values are determined solely by Shaper and cannot be
changed manually. Use the Min and Max sliders to scale the modulation range.
You can create a breakpoint by clicking anywhere in the display. Hold the Alt  (Win) / Option
(Mac) key while dragging between breakpoints to create curved segments. Hold Shift  and click a
breakpoint to delete it.
To remove the entire envelope from the display, press the Clear button in the bottom left corner. To the
right of the Clear button, you can choose from one of six presets to quickly create a new breakpoint
envelope.
Use the Grid slider to adjust the number of grid divisions in the display. When Snap is enabled, any
breakpoints that you create or reposition will automatically snap to the nearest grid line.
The smaller display at the top right of the device provides an oscilloscope-style view of the envelope’s
output signal.
The Jitter slider adds randomness to the envelope output, while the Smooth control softens any sharp
changes in the output, including those from applied jitter.
The Phase control shifts the position of the envelope output within its cycle from 0% (the start of the
cycle) to 100% (the end). Click the R (Retrigger) button to retrigger the envelope output from the
position defined by Phase. Note that the Retrigger button is grayed out when the Time Mode is set to
Sync.
The Offset control adjusts the center point of the envelope output. At 0%, the output is centered.
Positive values shift the output upward, while negative values shift it downward. The horizontal line in
the oscilloscope display indicates the center and can be a helpful visual reference when adjusting
Offset.
You Can Shift the Center Point of the Envelope Output Using Offset.
792


## 32.3 Max for Live MIDI Effects


### 32.3.1 Envelope MIDI

Shaper has three trigger modes: Loop, 1-Shot, and Manual. You can use the corresponding toggles to
switch between these modes.
Loop — The envelope loops continuously at the rate set by the Rate control.
1-Shot — The envelope can be triggered once using the mappable T button.
Manual — The envelope can be scrubbed forward and backward with the Manual control.
The Rate control sets the envelope rate. Use the Time Mode toggles to switch between frequency
values in Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions.
Depth sets the amount of modulation for all mapped parameters. At 0%, no modulation is applied,
while at 100% the envelope output is applied at its maximum level.
32.3 Max for Live MIDI Effects
32.3.1 Envelope MIDI
The Envelope MIDI Effect.
Envelope MIDI is a modulator device that uses an ADSR envelope to control mapped parameters.
You can map any automatable parameter in Live to Envelope MIDI, such as device or mixer
parameters. To do so, activate the Map button and click a parameter to assign it as a mapping target.

When Remote Control is enabled, parameter values are determined solely by Envelope MIDI and
cannot be changed manually. Use the Min and Max sliders to scale the modulation range.
You can use the Loop Mode drop-down to choose from one of four options: Free, Sync, Loop, and
Echo.
Free — The envelope is triggered each time a note is played.
Sync — The envelope is retriggered at the beat division specified by the Sync Rate drop-down.
Loop — The envelope loops at the rate defined by the Global Time control.
Echo — The envelope produces echoes at the interval set by the Env Echo Time control. The Env
Feedback control defines how much of each echo is fed back into the next, which affects how
long the echoes persist. Higher feedback values produce more sustained repetitions.

The LED next to the Loop Mode drop-down flashes each time the envelope is triggered.
Global Time scales the envelope duration. The default value is 1.00, which means the envelope
matches the timing defined by the ADSR values. Values above 1.00 stretch the envelope
proportionally, while values below 1.00 compress it.
The Amount control sets the amount of modulation for all mapped parameters. At 0%, no modulation
is applied, while at 100% the envelope output is applied at its maximum level.
Attack determines how long it takes for the envelope to reach its peak level after a note is played.
Decay sets the time it takes for the envelope to drop from that peak to the Sustain level.
The Sustain control defines the level at which the envelope remains after the Decay stage while a note
is held. The Release control sets how long it takes for the envelope to return to zero after a note is
released.
The Slope sliders below Attack, Decay, and Release can be used to create curved envelope segments
for the corresponding stages.
You can also adjust the Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release values, as well as the ADR slopes, by
clicking and dragging the envelope handles in the display.
When the Velocity toggle is enabled, the envelope’s peak level is scaled proportionally based on
incoming note velocity. Lower velocities result in a reduced peak level and more subtle modulation,
while higher velocities create a greater peak level and more noticeable modulation.
Use the Sustain toggle to switch the sustain function on or off. When on, the envelope remains at the
Sustain level for as long as a note is held and proceeds to the Release stage once the note is released.
When off, the envelope behaves like a one-shot: it moves through the Attack and Decay stages and
then proceeds to the Release stage regardless of how long a note is held.
795


### 32.3.2 Expression Control

32.3.2 Expression Control
The Expression Control Effect.
Expression Control is a modulator device that controls mapped parameters using different MIDI and
MPE sources.
There are five Mod Source tabs, each of which can be set to a specific MIDI or MPE source. Use the
MIDI Input Source drop-down menu to select one of ten expression parameters: Velocity, Modwheel,
Pitchbend, Pressure, Keytrack, Expression, Random, Increment, Slide, and Sustain.
You can map any automatable parameter in Live to the selected modulation source, such as device or
mixer parameters. To do so, activate the Map button and click a parameter to assign it as a mapping
target.
The controls in the Output Range section depend on the Modulation toggle at the top right of the
device. This toggle sets how Expression Control’s modulation values are generated, and has two
modes: Modulate or Remote Control.
When Modulate is selected, base values of a mapped parameter can be adjusted using your cursor.
In this mode, the value set or automated by Expression Control will be merged with the value being set
as you tweak the parameter in question. When Remote Control is selected, modulated parameter
values are set by Expression Control and interaction with base parameter values is no longer possible.
The Modulation toggle also affects Expression Control’s polarity modes. When Modulate is selected,
a Modulation Polarity toggle in the Output Range section lets you choose between bipolar and
unipolar modes. In Bipolar mode, modulation is centered around the base parameter value being
modulated. In Unipolar mode, modulation is added to the base parameter value being modulated.
The Output Range Max slider sets the output modulation value generated when the input signal is at
its maximum amplitude. When Remote Control is selected, the Output Range section lets you set
minimum and maximum output modulation values using the Output Range Min and Output Range
Max sliders.
796

The Curve Type buttons below the Curve Display can be used to select a linear or S-shaped curve.
The type of curve selected determines which controls are available in the Curve section.
When a linear curve (with two breakpoints) is selected, the Curve A dial adjusts the modulation
curve’s entire shape. When an S-shaped curve (with three breakpoints) is selected, the Curve A dial
adjusts the curve’s upper segment shape and the Curve B dial adjusts its lower segment shape. When
the Curve Link button is enabled, the curve’s upper and lower segments can be inversely adjusted
using only the Curve A dial.
The Curve Display provides a visualization of the modulation curve being generated by the device.
Minimum and maximum values for the curve can be set via the Min/Max sliders. When an S-shaped
curve is selected, the middle breakpoint’s horizontal and vertical positions can be set via the X-Y
sliders. Breakpoints and curve shape can also be adjusted by clicking and dragging the visualized
curve directly in the display.
When Increment is selected as a modulation source in any MIDI Input Source drop-down menu, the
Increment Steps slider is activated. This value defines how many note triggers are necessary to cycle
through the device’s entire modulation range, and can be set to a value from 1 to 32 steps. Stopping
transport will reset the count, so that the first note played when transport restarts will output the
minimum modulation value that has been set.
When Random is selected as a modulation source in any MIDI Input Source drop-down menu, the
Random Amount slider is activated. This slider sets how much random deviation is applied to the target
modulation value with each note trigger.
The Smoothing Type toggle lets you choose between linear or logarithmic smoothing between
modulation values.
The Smoothing Rise and Fall sliders set the amount of time it takes for increasing and decreasing
modulation values to reach the most recent value, from 0 to 1000 milliseconds.
797


### 32.3.3 MIDI Monitor

32.3.3 MIDI Monitor
The MIDI Monitor Effect.
MIDI Monitor is a utility MIDI device that displays incoming MIDI and MPE data.
MIDI data can be viewed in either the Note display or Flow diagram.
In the Note display, incoming MIDI notes are shown along with their root note and related chords (if
played) on a keyboard layout. Note velocity is also shown.
The Flow diagram populates a list of incoming MIDI notes and data (such as pitch bend and
aftertouch messages) in a continuous stream as notes are played. The Freeze toggle can be used to
freeze or unfreeze the display, while the Clear button clears the entire display.
798

The Flow Diagram.
MPE data can be viewed in the MPE display. Incoming note, velocity, slide, pressure and per-note
pitch data are shown in a continuous stream as notes are played.

### 32.3.4 MPE Control

32.3.4 MPE Control
The MPE Control Effect.
MPE Control is a Max for Live MIDI effect that allows shaping and transforming incoming MPE (MIDI
Polyphonic Expression) signals, and offers distinctive adjustment options for each MPE data source. It
is typically used in conjunction with another device to fine-tune the effect MPE data has on mapped
parameters. MPE Control also allows converting MPE signals to global MIDI, making it possible to
use an MPE controller with non-MPE enabled instruments.
Before we get into the details of how you can use the MPE Control effect to shape the incoming MPE
data, let’s have a look at the difference between MPE and standard MIDI messages. MPE enables
MIDI Control Change (or MIDI CC) messages to be sent on a per-note basis, thus allowing you to
articulate each note individually. Without MPE, those messages are sent globally, meaning that all
notes are affected by the MIDI CC being used. For more detailed information on MPE check out the 
Editing MPE chapter.
While MPE already allows a lot more musical expression than standard MIDI data, MPE Control
gives you the ability to shape the MPE signals to a greater extent using curves, making it possible to
play even more expressively. Let’s say you are using the Expression Control device and mapped its
Slide MIDI input to the Filter Freq knob in Operator. Any incoming MPE slide data will affect the filter
frequency. You can then use MPE Control to fine-tune the signal further, so that only very high slide
values will reach a high frequency cutoff.
In MPE Control, the incoming MPE signals can be transformed via two types of curves that can be
smoothed for consistent rise and fall times. There are three signal sources available: Press (pressure),
Slide, as well as NotePB (per-note pitch bend), and each can be adjusted individually.
800

The curve of the selected MPE source is shown in the foreground of the display, making that curve and
its respective controls available for editing. By default, all MPE sources are switched on, but they can
be deactivated separately by clicking on the toggles next to their names.
For each MPE source, you can choose between two types of curve settings in the bottom left corner of
the display: linear or S-shaped. The linear curve has two breakpoints, while the S-shaped curve has
three breakpoints.
Choosing the linear setting lets you adjust the curve in two ways. You can use either the Curve control
knob or click and drag the curve directly in the display. In addition to adjusting the curve, you can
also modify the minimum and maximum values using the Min and Max sliders, or by dragging the
breakpoints at the ends of the curve.
The linear setting provides one curve, creating a smooth ramp for the chosen modulation source,
either “compressing” the data, making it easier to stay in the lower range of values, or “expanding” it,
making it easier to reach higher values with less input.
When choosing the S-shaped curve, a third breakpoint is added to the middle of the curve’s line,
separating the curve into two distinct segments. This breakpoint is movable, allowing complete control
over the crossover point between the two segments, giving you the possibility to create much more
radical curves. The two segments are linked together by default. Toggling the Curve Link button
separates the segments from each other, so that they can be individually compressed or expanded
using the two independent Curve dials.
Note that the position of the breakpoint separating the two segments can be adjusted either by
directly clicking and dragging the breakpoint, or by using the X-Y controls at the bottom of the display.
The X-Y controls are only active when using the S-shaped curve.
Clicking on the triangular button in the bottom right of the visualization will unfold the advanced
settings panel.

#### 32.3.4.1 Press

MPE Control’s Expanded View.
All of the three modulation sources include the Smooth toggle which enables smoothing for the
currently selected source. Specific Rise and Fall values for each of the curves can be set
independently via the respective controls, and additional controls are available depending on the
source you are editing.
32.3.4.1 Press
The Press source can be used to alter MPE pressure data, which, similarly to polyphonic aftertouch, is
sent on a per-note basis when pressure is applied to a controller’s key or pad after it was initially
struck.
802


#### 32.3.4.2 Slide

Press Advanced Settings.
Press includes a Default toggle, which gives you the option to set a default MPE value to use with
MIDI notes that do not contain MPE data. You can also choose to send the MPE pressure data to the
Slide instead of the Press source by using the Swap to Slide toggle. This is useful when, for example,
you want to adjust the modulation via the vertical axis, but are using a controller which only supports
polyphonic aftertouch.
The Press to AT setting converts the MPE pressure data to monophonic aftertouch, so that non-MPE
instruments can be modulated via an MPE controller.
32.3.4.2 Slide
The Slide source modifies MPE slide data (transmitted as MIDI CC 74), which corresponds to the
vertical position of the finger on the controller key or pad.

#### 32.3.4.3 NotePB

Slide Advanced Settings.
Slide also includes a Default toggle for use with non-MPE data, as well as a Centered switch which is
useful when playing pad-based MPE controllers. When Centered is switched on, MPE slide data is
transformed so that hitting the center of the pad generates a modulation value of zero, and the
modulation value increases progressively as the finger slides away from the center alongside the
vertical axis.
By default, Slide is set to Abs mode, which means that MPE slide values are interpreted as absolute.
Switching the mode to Rel (relative) will set the slide values to start in the middle of the range,
regardless of where the finger is on the key or pad. They can then only be modified by further
sweeping the finger up and down while holding a note. In the Ons (onset) mode, MPE slide values
will only be updated with a Note On. Note that onset mode will automatically deactivate smoothing.
The Slide to Mod option transforms MPE slide messages to Mod Wheel (CC1) messages, allowing to
modulate non-MPE enabled instruments with an MPE controller.
32.3.4.3 NotePB
The NotePB source modifies the MPE per-note pitch bend data, which is produced by horizontal
movement on the controller’s keys or pads. Pitch bend by definition only affects the pitch or pitches
being produced.
804

NotePB Advanced Settings.
In the NotePB advanced settings, you can adjust the Pitch Range, which is useful in cases where the
hardware controller and the instrument’s pitch bend range do not match. For example, a setting of 2x
allows mapping an MPE controller with a +/- 48 semitone pitch bend range to an instrument whose
pitch bend range is +/- 24 semitones. If the Note Pitch Bend MIDI CC is mapped to anything other
than pitch, using higher values helps to cover a larger modulation range with a smaller movement.
When the NotePB to PB switch is switched on, MPE per-note pitch bend messages are translated to
standard MIDI messages, which makes it possible for MPE-enabled MIDI controllers to still send MIDI
information to instruments that do not receive MPE messages.

### 32.3.5 Note Echo

32.3.5 Note Echo
The Note Echo Effect.
Note Echo is an echo delay effect that creates additional MIDI notes at specific time intervals with
decreasing velocity.
Activate the Sync switch, which allows using the Delay Time beat division chooser. The numbered
switches represent time delay in 16th notes. For example, selecting ”4” delays the signal by four 16th
notes, which equals one beat (a quarter note) of delay.
Changing the Delay Time field percentage value shortens and extends delay times by fractional
amounts, thus producing the ”swing” type of timing effect found in drum machines.
If the Sync switch is off, the delay time reverts to milliseconds. To edit the delay time, click and drag the
Delay Time slider up or down, or click in the field and type in a value.
The Input switches lets you toggle between Thru/Mute playback modes. When Thru is active, both the
MIDI note and echo are played back. When Mute is active, the MIDI note is muted and only the echo
is audible.
Pitch sets the transposition amount applied to the note with each repeat of the echo.
Delay sets the amount of velocity applied to the echo. The Fback parameter defines how much of the
channel’s output signal feeds back into the delay line’s input.
Switching on the MPE toggle allows incoming MPE data to be echoed alongside MIDI notes and
velocity data. Otherwise, MPE data is filtered out.

### 32.3.6 Shaper MIDI

With the MPE toggle switched on, the Press, Slide, and Note PB sliders become active and define the
feedback amount for the pressure, slide and per-note pitch bend data respectively. Setting the
feedback amount to lower than 100% will cause the echoed MPE data to progressively decay with
each repetition.
32.3.6 Shaper MIDI
The Shaper MIDI Effect.
Shaper MIDI is a modulator device that uses a breakpoint envelope to generate mappable
modulation data. Unlike the Shaper audio effect, Shaper MIDI’s envelope modulation is triggered
with each MIDI note and can be affected by velocity.
You can map any automatable parameter in Live to Shaper MIDI, such as device or mixer
parameters. To do so, activate the Map button and click a parameter to assign it as a mapping target.
Use the Show/Hide Multimap button at the top right of the display to access additional mapping
buttons. You can map up to eight parameters in total.
You Can Map up to Eight Parameters.
To unassign a parameter, click the Unmap button to the right of the Map button.
807

Shaper MIDI can control mapped parameters in two different ways: Modulation and Remote Control.
Modulation is selected by default, but you can use the Mod toggle to switch to Remote Control.
When Modulation is enabled, parameter values can be freely adjusted even after they are mapped.
The Modulation Polarity toggle switches between the Bipolar and Unipolar modes. In Bipolar mode,
modulation occurs in both directions with the base value at the center. In Unipolar mode, modulation
is applied in a single direction from the base value. Use the Modulation Amount slider to set the
modulation depth. This determines the modulation range relative to the base value.
When Remote Control is enabled, parameter values are determined solely by Shaper MIDI and
cannot be changed manually. Use the Min and Max sliders to scale the modulation range.
To create a breakpoint, click anywhere in the display. You can create a sustain breakpoint by holding 
Ctrl  (Win) / Cmd  (Mac) while clicking in the display. The sustain breakpoint is larger to
distinguish it from the regular breakpoints in the display. Only one sustain breakpoint can be created
per envelope. With a sustain breakpoint, the envelope remains at the sustain level for as long as a
note is held.
Use a Sustain Breakpoint to Keep the Envelope at a Specific Level While a Note is Held.
Hold the Alt  (Win) / Option  (Mac) key while dragging between breakpoints to create curved
segments. Hold Shift  and click a breakpoint to delete it.
To remove the entire envelope from the display, press the Clear button in the bottom left corner. To the
right of the Clear button, you can choose from one of six presets to quickly create a new breakpoint
envelope.
Use the Grid slider to adjust the number of grid divisions in the display. When Snap is enabled, any
breakpoints that you create or reposition will automatically snap to the nearest grid line.
The smaller display at the top right of the device provides an oscilloscope-style view of the envelope’s
output signal. The LED in the display flashes each time the envelope is triggered.
The Jitter slider adds randomness to the envelope output, while the Smooth control softens any sharp
changes in the output, including those from applied jitter.
You can set how much velocity affects the modulation depth using the Velocity control. At 0%, velocity
has no effect and the envelope output remains at a constant amplitude. At higher values, lower
808

velocities scale the envelope output down to produce a more subtle modulation, while higher
velocities scale the output up for a more noticeable effect.
The Offset control adjusts the center point of the envelope output. At 0%, the output is centered.
Positive values shift the output upward, while negative values shift it downward. The horizontal line in
the oscilloscope display indicates the center and can be a helpful visual reference when adjusting
Offset.
You Can Shift the Center Point of the Envelope Output Using Offset.
Activate the Loop toggle to repeat the envelope at the rate specified by the Rate control for as long as
a MIDI note is held. When Loop is enabled, the sustain breakpoint level is bypassed.
The Rate control sets the envelope rate. Use the Time Mode toggles to switch between frequency
values in Hertz and tempo-synced beat divisions.
Depth sets the amount of modulation for all mapped parameters. At 0%, no modulation is applied,
while at 100% the envelope output is applied at its maximum level.
You can add echoes to the envelope output using Echo and Time. The Echo control defines how much
of each echo is fed back into the next, which affects how long the echoes persist. Higher values
produce more sustained repetitions. The Time control sets the interval at which the echoes occur.
Use the Echo and Time Controls to Add Echoes to the Envelope Output.
