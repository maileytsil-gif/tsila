```rust
//! Roland Juno-60 style single-DCO poly synthesizer with BBD chorus.
//!
//! The whole front panel, in the order it appears on the instrument: LFO,
//! DCO, HPF, VCF, VCA, ENV, CHORUS. One DCO per voice (falling saw, pulse
//! phase-locked to it, divide-by-two sub, noise), the four-position
//! non-resonant HPF, an IR3109 four-pole low-pass, one ADSR shared by the
//! filter and the amplifier, and the BBD chorus in its three modes.
//!
//! Where a number here came from a measurement of the real instrument it says
//! so at the constant. The measurements are Andy Harman's Juno-60 analysis
//! (github.com/pendragon-andyh/Juno60), which is a slider-by-slider capture of
//! a working unit rather than a reading of the service notes.
//!
//! The preset bank is the instrument's own: all 56 factory patches, 11 to 78,
//! read off Roland's published patch charts. Every slider position and switch
//! state in `BANK` was measured from the printed panel of its chart rather
//! than dialled in by ear, which is why the presets are held in panel units
//! here and converted to seconds and hertz on the way into the engine — the
//! chart records where the cap sat, and the seconds are what that means.

/// Sized on ordinary playing, in step with the other four — see `OUTPUT_TRIM`
/// in dx7.rs, which carries the full reasoning. The trim lands this synth's
/// median patch at the same loudness as theirs.
///
/// It moved when the factory bank replaced the hand-voiced one, because that
/// is what it is for: the factory patches use their LEVEL slider as a mix
/// control and sit at 0.51 in the middle of the bank where every hand-voiced
/// patch had been left at 0.75, so the same trim put the whole instrument
/// 3.9 dB below the other four. `instruments_are_level_matched` is the

/// Measured across all 56 on an eight-note chord at velocity 127: the loudest
/// attack is 44 TUBA at 0.515 out of the instrument, and the loudest sample

/// the patch is a noise wash swept by an 0.31 Hz LFO. Held for thirty seconds
/// it goes no further. Six voices, so an eight-note chord steals two of them —

//
// * the OCTAVE TRANSPOSE switch, which the manual says is memorised with the
//   patch but which the printed panel on the chart leaves out. The `range`
//   column is Andy Harman's transcription of the same bank;
// * the HPF, drawn on the chart as a slider though the control has four
//   detents. The caps cluster on four heights and `hpf` is which one, with
//   the bass patches at the bottom of the travel and the reeds at the top.
//
// The chart also records knob positions that do nothing on their patch —
// Roland say as much in the manual — the commonest being a SUB OSC fader left
