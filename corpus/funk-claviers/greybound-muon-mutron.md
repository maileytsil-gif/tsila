title: Muon
description: Mu-Tron III-inspired envelope filter engineering baseline.
```

Muon is Greybound's first envelope filter model. The reference direction is the Mu-Tron III family: a touch-sensitive filter known for vocal, percussive, organic sweeps rather than clocked modulation.

The implementation does not copy a factory schematic. It is a graybox model that captures the useful engineering behavior: high input impedance, an envelope detector, program-dependent sweep memory, a resonant band-pass filter, dry/wet blend, and low output impedance.

## Baseline Assumptions

- Input impedance is high enough for guitar, compressor, or drive outputs.
- Output impedance is low enough to drive another pedal or the amp input.
- The detector belongs to private pedal state and follows guitar attack faster than it releases.
- The filter should open from pick attack and close musically as the note decays.
- Pre-amp placement is the reference rig because envelope filters usually react best before amp gain and time-based effects.

## Controls

- `sensitivity`: envelope detector drive and sweep trigger threshold.
- `range`: low-to-high sweep span and release feel.
- `resonance`: band-pass emphasis around the moving center frequency.
- `mix`: dry/filter blend.
- `bypass`: routing state; detector and filter state remain owned by the pedal instance.

## Current DSP Approximation

The current implementation uses:

- source/load input boundary and light input coupling,
- rectified sidechain with one-pole smoothing,
- fast envelope attack and slower release,
- exponential center-frequency sweep from low-mid to upper-mid range,
- state-variable band-pass filter with bounded resonance,
- dry body retention so the effect does not disappear at high mix settings,
- output lowpass and headroom guard.

This is not a SPICE model and it is not component-exact. It gives Greybound a dynamic touch filter while leaving room for future diode/op-amp/OTA or opto-style circuit validation.

## Reference Direction

Useful future reference work:

- collect public Mu-Tron III topology notes and measured sweeps,
- compare low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass modes,
- add up/down sweep direction if the model needs the full original control behavior,
- validate envelope attack/release against rendered pick transients,
- measure output level across sensitivity and resonance settings,
- compare placement before and after compressor/drive pedals.

## Validation Gates

The model is not component-exact until:

- center-frequency sweep is measured across sensitivity and range settings,
- resonance is validated for stability and musical output level,
- attack and release are measured from rendered transient material,
- bypass and active output levels are matched within a useful range,
- ordering before/after compressor and overdrive is compared with renders,
- measured hardware or SPICE captures define a specific reference unit.
