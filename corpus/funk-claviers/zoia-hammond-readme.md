# Hammond

Hammond is a 9-drawbar Hammond Organ simulator with a Leslie.  It is effectively an additive synthesizer.

A Hammond Organ voice is built by adding together nine (roughly) sine waves of specific frequencies, produced using tonewheels (essentially metal wheels with teeth) which spin near to pickups.  The volume of each sine wave is controlled by a drawbar which is set to values from 0...8, where 8 is full volume.  The resulting waves are then summed (mixed).

You can simulate this by creating nine sine wave oscillators of the right frequencies, then pushing each one through its own VCA to set its volume, then adding them together.

Hammond Organs often are often accompanied by Leslie speaker cabinets.  A Leslie speaker is essentially a speaker horn attached to and spinning on a turntable.  When the horn is facing you, it's louder than when it is facing away from you, and so the spinning causes a tremelo effect.  Furthermore, due to the Doppler Effect, the horn rises in pitch as the horn spins towards you, and lowers in pitch as it spins away, which produces a vibrato effect.

Thus you can simulate a Leslie by simply taking the sound and pushing it through both a tremelo and a vibrato effect.

So that's what we're doing.

### Page 0: Keyboard

The front page is a 40-note keyboard module.  It does what you expect.

### Page 1: Oscillators

There are nine Oscillators producing sine ways, each with a Value in front of it to adjust its pitch relative to the keyboard.  On oscillator has an additional negative Value on the bottom right of the screen to lower its pitch.  An additional Value adjusts the pitch of all oscillators relative to the Keyboard.

### Page 2: Drawbars

Nine VCAs which control the volume of each of the oscillators.  You can change the timbre of the Organ by changing these volumes.  Unfortunately creating Value objects for specific drawbar settings would be difficult.  Instead, you can set the drawbar settings roughly as follows:

    DRAWBAR VALUE    dB
    0          		-Inf
    1          		-21
    2          		-18
    3          		-15
    4          		-12
    5          		-9
    6          		-6
    7          		-3
    8          		 0
    
### Page 3: Leslie-Out

The nine VCAs on Page 2 are then routed through a VCA biased by a Value (first row) which turn the sound on/off according to the keyboard gate, then into the Vibrato (second row), then a Tremelo (third row) for the Leslie effect, then a Hall Reverb (fourth row) for, you know, reverb, and finally to Out (fifth row).  You can reduce the vibrato width or tremelo depth if they are too strong: but the tremelo/vibrato rate are both set to 166.7ms, which I believe is the classic "fast" setting on the Leslie speaker.

### Bugs

Even though these are just sine waves, they reveal strange artifacts at different pitches, which tells me that there are probably bugs in the Zoia's sine wave generation.  It's not aliasing: sine waves are unlikely to alias at this pitch as they have only one partial each.

### Some Famous Drawbar Settings

The drawbar VCAs on Page 2 are organized as:

    111666..
    222777..
    333888..
    444999..
    555.....
   
   Here are some well known drawbar settings (the nine numbers are organized Drawbar 1 through 9, left to right).  Use the earlier Drawbar Value to dB table to set the VCAs.
