## Tier C — Wrong aesthetic but still mineable

These packs were commissioned for genres far from minimal/microhouse/ambient, but every one contains *raw material* (one-shots, noise beds, dry multisamples) worth extracting. Never load the preset chains. Never use the genre MIDI. Strip the kits.

### Build and Drop (Puremagnetik)
- **Essence:** Festival EDM construction kits — 808s, saw-leads, risers, drops.
- **Scores:** Minimal 1 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 2
- **Top:** Riser/downlifter **sample folders** only — strip the kick+lead presets. 808 sub-tails repitched as minimal bass layers.
- **Use when:** need a risk-free atmospheric riser or noise sweep. Everything else is throwaway.
- **Avoid:** All preset racks — saturation chains are over-cooked for minimal.

### Drive and Glow (Native Instruments / Ableton)
- **Essence:** Saturated indie/synthwave chains — soft-clipped leads, tape-emulation pads.
- **Scores:** Minimal 2 / Dub 3 / Cinematic 3
- **Top:** Effect Racks for the saturation chains only — copy the guts (Saturator → Shifter → tape delay) and drop into your own signal path. Tape-flutter pads at -30 dB as hidden glue.
- **Use when:** want soft warmth without building the chain yourself.
- **Avoid:** All synthwave lead presets — wrong decade.

### Punch and Tilt (Ableton)
- **Essence:** Warehouse techno kit generator — rave stabs, distorted kicks, tilted hats.
- **Scores:** Minimal 3 / Dub 4 / Cinematic 1
- **Top:** Distorted kick one-shots (Drum Rack extraction), not the preset kicks-through-Drum-Buss chains. Tilted/pitched ride-cymbal samples as alien hi-hats.
- **Use when:** need warehouse grit without going full hardcore. Villalobos occasionally pitches these down 2 octaves.
- **Avoid:** MIDI clips — 130 BPM warehouse patterns, wrong tempo for minimal.

### Skitter and Step (Ableton)
- **Essence:** UK garage / 2-step / UKG percussion — hats, shuffled snares, vocal chops.
- **Scores:** Minimal 2 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 1
- **Top:** Shuffled closed-hat samples (built for 2-step, work for microhouse). Vocal "chop-and-cut" one-shots for Akufen stutter inputs.
- **Use when:** need shuffled hi-hat character that standard 909/606 doesn't give.
- **Avoid:** Garage bassline presets — wrong frequency balance for minimal bass.

### Trap Drums (Sound Oracle / Ableton)
- **Essence:** Modern trap kits — sub 808s, snappy snares, tight rolls.
- **Scores:** Minimal 1 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 1
- **Top:** **808 sub-tails only** as sub-bass layers under a minimal kick. Snappy clap one-shots as high-velocity accents (strip from kits).
- **Use when:** need sub-heavy low end without building an 808 from scratch.
- **Avoid:** Entire kits, all hi-hat MIDI rolls (trap signature, wrong for minimal).

### Beat Tools
- **Essence:** Generic drum-programming toolkit — kicks, snares, hats, claps, percs.
- **Scores:** Minimal 2 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 2
- **Top:** Raw one-shots — cherry-pick specific samples (a particular snap, a particular hat) and ignore the preset kits. Good "neutral" source material if you don't want a pack with opinions.
- **Use when:** building a kit from scratch, want neutral one-shots without aesthetic opinion.
- **Avoid:** Preset Drum Racks — too generic, no character.

### Drum Essentials
- **Essence:** Live 12's baseline drum kit library — acoustic + electronic + percussion across 30+ kits.
- **Scores:** Minimal 1 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 1
- **Top:** Goldbaby 606 and 808 samples (hidden in the electronic kit folders). Acoustic side-stick and rim-shot one-shots.
- **Use when:** need a specific drum-machine sample, not an entire kit.
- **Avoid:** Default kits — too safe, no character.

### SONiVOX Orchestral Brass
- **Essence:** 11 multisampled brass instruments — trumpet, French horn, trombone, tuba, ensembles.
- **Scores:** Minimal 3 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 5
- **Top:** Solo **muted French horn** pp for dusty Arpiar/Cinematic moments. Solo trumpet pp with long release as sustained pitch drone.
- **Use when:** need a single sustained brass note as a foreground texture — NEVER as ensemble.
- **Avoid:** All ensemble patches — too Hollywood for minimal.

### SONiVOX Orchestral Strings
- **Essence:** 12 multisampled strings — violins, violas, cellos, double basses, ensembles.
- **Scores:** Minimal 3 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 5
- **Top:** **Pizzicato double-bass** as ghost/kick layer in minimal — short, warm, percussive. **Solo cello sustain pp** for bass-register atmosphere bed.
- **Use when:** need pizzicato accents or single-note sustained string pad at low dynamic.
- **Avoid:** Ensemble sustains, legato patches — Hollywood energy.

### SONiVOX Orchestral Woodwinds
- **Essence:** 10 multisampled woodwinds — flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, ensembles.
- **Scores:** Minimal 3 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 5
- **Top:** **Solo flute pp sustained** through PitchLoop89 for drifting high register. **Solo bass clarinet pp** as low-register hidden-voice color.
- **Use when:** need a specific single woodwind color for a single note or short phrase.
- **Avoid:** Fast articulations, ensembles — too classical.

### Grand Piano (e-instruments)
- **Essence:** Steinway-style multisampled concert grand.
- **Scores:** Minimal 3 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 5
- **Top:** **Single staccato note** with fast release at velocity 60-90 as percussive 'tock'/'thunk'. Lid-open for resonance. Use Upright Piano (Spitfire Bechstein, Tier S) for anything sustained.
- **Use when:** need a percussive pitched hit, not a piano performance.
- **Avoid:** Sustained chords (too bright/concert-hall), legato phrases.

### Synth Essentials
- **Essence:** Default Live preset collection across Operator/Analog/Wavetable/Drift.
- **Scores:** Minimal 2 / Dub 2 / Cinematic 3
- **Top:** **Tension + Collision physical-modeling presets** for unusual bowed/struck sounds that aren't obvious presets. Otherwise build from scratch — Operator sine + one-op FM is more useful than any preset here.
- **Use when:** need a quick physical-modeling starter; otherwise build from scratch.
- **Avoid:** "Lead" / "Pad" category — too finished, all the same.

### Session Drums Club
- **Essence:** Acoustic drum kit recorded in a live club/medium room — ambient kit with baked-in room mics.
- **Scores:** Minimal 3 / Dub 3 / Cinematic 3
- **Top:** **Side-stick / rim-shot** as main snare or accent in minimal. Tambourine + delay as ghost rattles. Room ambience is already baked in — don't add more reverb.
- **Use when:** want a drum bed that fights your space (room mics add their own reverb character).
- **Avoid:** Full kits through Drum Buss — too rock.

### Session Drums Studio
- **Essence:** Dry studio-recorded acoustic kit — clean, no room, close-mic'd.
- **Scores:** Minimal 3 / Dub 3 / Cinematic 3
- **Top:** **Dry rim/brush snare** as starting point for Convolution Reverb experiments (apply your own space). Brush one-shots as percussion texture.
- **Use when:** want a drum source you can fully control spatially — apply your own reverb, don't fight theirs.
- **Avoid:** Direct preset use — the dryness feels sterile without post-processing.

### Core Library
- **Essence:** Everything that ships with Live 12 — all native presets across Analog/Operator/Wavetable/Drift/Simpler/Sampler + all native effect presets + the bundled sample library (Ambient & Atmospheres, Noise & FX, Live Essentials samples).
- **Scores:** Minimal 3 / Dub 3 / Cinematic 3
- **Top:** **Ambient & Atmospheres + Noise & FX sample folders** — the unsung gold. "Ethereal Voice 01-04 Dmin 90bpm", "FX Vocal Chant Backwards", "Vocal Chant Aye", "Ethereal Adlib Vocal" are hidden Villalobos bait. Search `samples` path first in `search_browser` before reaching for Splice.
- **Use when:** hunt these folders BEFORE opening any other pack. Most of Live's best texture material is hiding here.
- **Avoid:** Named genre presets ("Lead", "Pad", "Bass" categories in each synth) — too generic. Also avoid "Drum Kit Essentials" defaults — go to dedicated drum packs instead.

## Workflow: what to do when

**"Build me a minimal-techno track"**
1. Drone Lab (Harmonic Drone Generator bed) + Glitch and Wash (field recording atmosphere) + Latin Percussion (cuica + claves)
2. Add Granulator III on a return for vocal clouds
3. PitchLoop89 + Convolution Reverb at end of any sustained element
4. Phase Pattern on drum clips for organic timing
5. Variations on chord stabs for evolution without automation

**"Build a drum kit from samples"**
1. Golden Era Hip-Hop Drums (dusty snares) + Drum Booth (dry acoustic) + Latin Percussion (unusual hits)
2. Use `add_drum_rack_pad` tool — never repeated `load_browser_item`
3. Each sample → role-aware Simpler defaults via `load_browser_item(role="drum")`

**"Make it evolve"**
1. Granulator III Cloud mode on sustained elements
2. Variations with quantized morph on effect chains
3. Vector Map for coupled multi-parameter physical motion
4. SQ Sequencer with asymmetric per-lane lengths

**"Make it weird without making it wrong"**
1. Microtuner with 19-TET or Pelog scale
2. Harmonic Drone Generator in just intonation
3. Bouncy Notes / Tree Tone for unpredictable pattern generation
4. Inspired by Nature generally — physics-driven sound design
