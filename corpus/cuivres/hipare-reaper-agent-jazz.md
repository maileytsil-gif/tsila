## Recording Philosophy

### Key Principles

1. **Capture the performance** - Minimal intervention
2. **Preserve dynamics** - Full range from pp to ff
3. **Room sound matters** - Natural acoustics
4. **Musician interaction** - Live recording preferred
5. **Less is more** - Minimal processing

### Mic Techniques

**Drums:**
```
Overhead pair: Spaced or coincident
Kick: Optional, often just overheads
Room mics: For ambience
Minimal close-micing
```

**Upright Bass:**
```
- Condenser or ribbon 6-12" from f-hole
- Optional: Pickup blend for definition
- Room mic for natural sound
```

**Piano:**
```
- Spaced pair inside lid
- Room mics for concert feel
- Lid position affects brightness
```

**Horns:**
```
- Ribbon or condenser
- 6-18" from bell
- Off-axis for less brightness
- Room for natural sound
```

## EQ Guidelines

### Philosophy

Jazz mixing requires **restraint**. Goal is natural, not processed.

### Upright Bass
```
HPF: 30-40 Hz (careful!)
Boost: 80-100 Hz (warmth)
Cut: 200-400 Hz (if muddy)
Boost: 700-1500 Hz (finger articulation)
```

### Drums
```
Kick: Natural, not modern "click"
Snare: Open, ringy (especially with brushes)
Cymbals: Natural shimmer, no harsh boosts
Overall: Less processing than any other genre
```

### Piano
```
HPF: 60-80 Hz
Generally: Leave alone
Presence: Gentle boost 2-4 kHz if needed
Air: 10-12 kHz for "silk"
```

### Saxophone
```
HPF: 100-150 Hz
Cut: 300-500 Hz (honkiness, if present)
Presence: 2-4 kHz (natural, not boosted)
Air: 8-12 kHz (breath, subtlety)
```

### Trumpet
```
HPF: 150-200 Hz
Cut: 1-2 kHz (if harsh)
Be careful: Brass is naturally bright
```

## Compression Guidelines

### Philosophy

**Dynamics are part of jazz.** From pianissimo to fortissimo, dynamics tell the story. Compress minimally or not at all.

### General Settings (if used)
```
Ratio: 2:1 - 3:1 (very gentle)
Attack: Slow (30-50 ms) - preserve transients
Release: Slow (200-300 ms)
Gain Reduction: 1-3 dB maximum
```

### Upright Bass
```
Optional: Light leveling only
Ratio: 2:1
Goal: Even out extreme dynamics
Preserve: Attack and articulation
```

### Master Bus
```
Often: No compression at all
If used: 1-2 dB GR maximum
Jazz is NOT about loudness competition
```

## Reverb and Space

### Philosophy

**The room is the reverb.** If recording in a good space, natural acoustics may be enough.

### Reverb Settings (for studio recordings)
```
Type: Hall or chamber (real space simulation)
Decay: 1.5-3s (depending on venue simulation)
Goal: All instruments in same "room"
Pre-delay: 20-40 ms for clarity
```

### Creating Cohesion
```
Use SAME reverb for all instruments
Send amounts vary but shared space
Simulates musicians playing together
```

### Delay
```
Rarely used in traditional jazz
Exception: Some fusion styles
If used: Very subtle, short slap-back
```

## Mixing Jazz

### Balance Goals

1. **Natural** - Sounds like a real performance
2. **Dynamic** - Full range preserved
3. **Cohesive** - Musicians in same space
4. **Clear** - Every instrument audible
5. **Warm** - Analog character, not clinical

### Typical Balance
```
Drums: Foundation, not dominant
Bass: Present, supportive
Piano: Fill, comping, occasional lead
Horns: Melody, solos
Overall: Ensemble balance, no element dominates
```

### Stereo Image

**Traditional placement (audience perspective):**
```
Left: Piano, guitar
Center: Bass, drums (kick/snare)
Right: Horns
Wide: Cymbals, room ambience
```

### Target Loudness

| Style | Target LUFS |
|-------|-------------|
| Traditional Jazz | -16 to -20 |
| Modern Jazz | -14 to -16 |
| Fusion | -12 to -14 |
| Smooth Jazz | -10 to -12 |

**Note:** Jazz typically has highest dynamic range of any genre

## Subgenre-Specific Tips

### Bebop

- **Tempo**: Fast (180-280 BPM)
- **Sound**: Dry, intimate, club-like
- **Focus**: Individual virtuosity
- **Mix**: Tight, present

### Cool Jazz

- **Tempo**: Often slower, relaxed
- **Sound**: Spacious, airy
- **Reverb**: More than bebop
- **Feel**: Laid back, smooth

### Fusion

- **Instruments**: Electric bass, synths, Rhodes
- **Processing**: More acceptable (effects, compression)
- **Sound**: Modern, produced
- **Mix**: Closer to rock approach

### Big Band

- **Size**: 15-20 musicians
- **Sections**: Brass, reeds, rhythm
- **Stereo**: Wide, orchestral layout
- **Dynamics**: Extreme range
- **Balance**: Section balance critical

### Modern/Contemporary (Snarky Puppy)

- **Production**: More polished
- **Elements**: Sometimes electronic
- **Dynamics**: Still important
- **Mix**: Modern techniques acceptable

## Reference Recordings

| Style | Album | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Modal | Miles Davis - "Kind of Blue" | Reference standard |
| Bebop | Charlie Parker - "Bird & Diz" | Classic sound |
| Piano Trio | Bill Evans - "Waltz for Debby" | Intimate, dynamic |
| Big Band | Duke Ellington - "Ellington at Newport" | Live energy |
| Fusion | Weather Report - "Heavy Weather" | Production quality |
| Modern | Snarky Puppy - "We Like It Here" | Contemporary approach |

## Free Plugin Suggestions

**Reverb:**
- Dragonfly Reverb (hall/room)
- OrilRiver

**Saturation:**
- Chow Tape Model (tape warmth)
- Analog Obsession plugins

**EQ:**
- TDR Nova (surgical if needed)

**Piano:**
- Piano One (Steinway samples)
- Spitfire LABS (free instruments)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-compressing**: Kills the life of jazz
2. **Too much processing**: Jazz is about the performance
3. **Ignoring dynamics**: Essential to the genre
4. **Wrong reverb**: Too long, washy, artificial
5. **Quantizing**: Never grid-edit jazz timing!
6. **Too loud**: Jazz isn't about loudness wars
7. **Separate reverbs**: Breaks ensemble cohesion

## Production Tips

1. **Record live together**: Interaction is key
2. **Good room > plugins**: Acoustic space matters
3. **Trust the musicians**: They know what they want
4. **Reference classic recordings**: Rudy Van Gelder, Blue Note
5. **Less processing**: When in doubt, do less
6. **Preserve mistakes**: "Wrong" notes are often right
7. **Dynamic range**: Don't squash it!
